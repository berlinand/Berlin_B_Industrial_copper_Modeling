# INTRODUCTION:
In the Industrial Copper Modeling dataset, the first step is to clean the data by removing or filling null values, dropping unnecessary columns, identifying and removing outliers, and normalizing the skewness to achieve a normal distribution.  machine learning is performed using classification and regression models to train and test the data, aiming for maximum accuracy and less error.
## Random sampling
This check box give user to selcet how many random sample needed from given dataset

## capping
By selecting capping the outliers are completly removed in dataset

## before or after
By selecting before it gives te value of before removing outlier and adjusting skewness 
By selecting after it gives te value of after removing outlier and adjusting skewness
